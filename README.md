# finer-vision-test-react-redux-nodejs-express-mongodb
I created the front end section using react-redux and material ui in the client folder.
I connected the api I wrote using the nodejs-express library in the server folder to mongoDB.
The user information received in the accordion menu is sent to mongoDB with the submit button.
The user information saved in MongoDb is instantly retrieved and displayed with the card.
